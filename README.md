# FIR-FILTER
This repository contains complete implementation of the 4 Tap FIR filter Using Verilog HDL for implementation algorithms and Python script for printing input and the output samples.
Here first i have given verilog code for the implementation algorithms and generate its output samples and then after access that file using simple python script for ploted that samples to make complete implementation of the Filter.
